# Documentation Overview

This project computes segment-level and city-level cyclability metrics from OpenStreetMap data.

The present documentation is organized as follows:
- `data_model.md`: data objects employed and associated assumptions.
- `pipeline.md`: ingestion, metrics computation, and database process.
- `metrics.md`: definition of a simplified cyclability metrics model.
- `database.md`: brief description of PostGIS schema used.
